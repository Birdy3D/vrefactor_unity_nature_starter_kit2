This example was made using Unity 2017.1. The example scene contains a SteamVR Camera Rig in a nature setting with a stereo mirror. It's a good scene for testing or demonstrating VR IK capabilities. Just add a character and IK.

# Performance NOTES
There are nasty CPU spikes due to Culling when using Terrain: [unity forum thread](https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-terrain-and-grass-cpu-spikes-in-terrain-data-buildpatchmesh.249089/)
As far as I can tell this is a Terrain problem and is fairly well known.
